  abstract = "The functional architecture of the object vision pathway in the
              human brain was investigated using functional magnetic resonance
              imaging to measure patterns of response in ventral temporal
              cortex while subjects viewed faces, cats, five categories of
              man-made objects, and nonsense pictures. A distinct pattern of
              response was found for each stimulus category. The
              distinctiveness of the response to a given category was not due
              simply to the regions that responded maximally to that category,
              because the category being viewed also could be identified on the
              basis of the pattern of response when those regions were excluded
              from the analysis. Patterns of response that discriminated among
              all categories were found even within cortical regions that
              responded maximally to only one category. These results indicate
              that the representations of faces and objects in ventral temporal
              cortex are widely distributed and overlapping.",
